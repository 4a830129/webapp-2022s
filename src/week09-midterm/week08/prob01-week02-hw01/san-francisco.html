        This beautiful city is popular the world over due to its cable cars and the iconic Golden Gate Bridge. But there
        is more to the city than meets the tourist's eye. San Francisco also boasts of a unique mix of seaside views and
        diverse dining options, thanks to an area known as Fisherman's Wharf. Those who love vintage clothing and vinyl
        records may head over to Haight Ashbury to get their fill of the oldies but goodies. Hundreds of centuries-old
        buildings in the Presidio are also available for the history buffs.
