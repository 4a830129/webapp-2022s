    <h1>San Francisco</h1>
    <p>United States · 理想停留天數: 4 天</p>

    <p>
        This beautiful city is popular the world over due to its cable cars and the iconic Golden Gate Bridge. But there is more to the city than meets the tourist's eye. San Francisco also boasts of a unique mix of seaside views and diverse dining options, thanks to an area known as Fisherman's Wharf. Those who love vintage clothing and vinyl records may head over to Haight Ashbury to get their fill of the oldies but goodies. Hundreds of centuries-old buildings in the Presidio are also available for the history buffs.
